## Smart UI development in 2025

In modern web development, speed and consistency are everything. If you're still **building every button, modal, or dropdown from scratch**, you’re spending time on problems that are already solved. That’s where **ShadCN UI** comes in — a component collection built with **Radix UI** and styled using **Tailwind CSS**, designed to let you focus on building features, not components.

## What is ShadCN UI?

[ShadCN UI](https://ui.shadcn.dev/) is **not a traditional component library** — it’s a collection of copy-pasteable components that live _in your codebase_. This gives you full control over styles, behavior, and accessibility — without starting from scratch.

### Key features

- Fully **customizable** components
- Based on **Radix UI primitives** (great accessibility)
- Styled with **Tailwind CSS**
- You own the code — no library lock-in

## Why use ShadCN instead of building everything?

Let’s compare two approaches:

<CodeBlock
  marginBottom="16"
  codes={[
    {
      code:
`// Building a modal manually
<div className="fixed inset-0 z-50">
  <div className="bg-white p-6 rounded shadow-lg">
    <h2>Title</h2>
    <p>Modal content</p>
  </div>
</div>`,
      language: "tsx",
      label: "Manual Modal"
    },
    {
      code:
`// Using ShadCN Dialog
import { Dialog, DialogContent, DialogTrigger } from "@/components/ui/dialog";

<Dialog>
  <DialogTrigger>Open</DialogTrigger>
  <DialogContent>
    <h2>Title</h2>
    <p>Modal content</p>
  </DialogContent>
</Dialog>
`, language: "tsx", label: "ShadCN Modal" } ]} />

### Pros of using ShadCN:

- 🧠 **Smarter**: Skip the accessibility and focus traps — it's already done
- 🧱 **Consistent**: Every component follows the same design system
- 🚀 **Faster**: Add a modal, dropdown, or toast in seconds
- 🧩 **Composable**: Works with your Tailwind setup out of the box

## Getting started with ShadCN UI

1. Make sure you have Tailwind + Radix UI setup.
2. Run the install command:
   ```bash
   npx shadcn-ui@latest init
   ```
3. Use the CLI to add components:
   ```bash
   npx shadcn-ui@latest add button
   ```

Now you're ready to use `<Button />`, `<Dialog />`, `<Popover />`, and more.

## The smarter way to build UIs

In 2025, productivity is the name of the game. If a tool gives you well-designed, accessible, customizable UI components out of the box — and still keeps your codebase clean — it’s a win.
ShadCN UI isn’t about shortcuts. It’s about working smart, not hard.
