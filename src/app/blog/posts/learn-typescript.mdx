## The rise of TypeScript

In 2025, TypeScript is no longer just a “nice to have” — it’s becoming a **requirement** in many modern JavaScript codebases. With growing project complexity, the benefits of static typing are clearer than ever. TypeScript helps developers catch bugs earlier, improve code readability, and build scalable systems.

## What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a **superset of JavaScript** that adds optional static types. It compiles down to clean, readable JavaScript, meaning you can run it anywhere JS runs — in the browser, in Node.js, and beyond.

  codes={[
    {
      code:
`// JavaScript
function greet(name) {
  return "Hello, " + name;
}

// TypeScript
function greet(name: string): string {
  return "Hello, " + name;
}`,
      language: "ts",
      label: "JavaScript vs TypeScript"
    }
  ]}
/>

## Benefits of TypeScript

Here’s why TypeScript is worth your time:

- **Early bug detection**: TypeScript spots bugs during development.
- **Better IDE support**: Autocompletion, inline docs, and refactoring tools.
- **Improved readability**: Types make the code more understandable for teams.
- **Scalability**: Crucial for large apps and teams with multiple developers.

## Growing ecosystem

TypeScript is widely adopted across major frameworks and libraries:

- **React + TypeScript**: Improved prop type safety.
- **Next.js**: TypeScript support out-of-the-box.
- **Node.js apps**: More maintainable APIs and services.

<CodeBlock
  marginBottom="16"
  codes={[
    {
      code:
`type User = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
};

function getUser(id: number): User {
  // Fetch and return user
}`,
      language: "ts",
      label: "Typed API response example"
    }
  ]}
/>

## Getting started

To start using TypeScript:

1. Install it globally or locally:  
   `npm install -D typescript`
2. Initialize your project:  
   `npx tsc --init`
3. Start renaming `.js` files to `.ts` and gradually add types.

## Final thoughts

Whether you're a frontend, backend, or full-stack developer, learning TypeScript in 2025 is a wise investment. It boosts code quality, reduces bugs, and makes you a more confident and capable engineer.
