## Why choose Expo?

If you're new to mobile app development, Expo is one of the easiest ways to get started. It’s a framework and platform built around **React Native**, allowing you to write JavaScript/TypeScript and run your app on both iOS and Android — without configuring Xcode or Android Studio.

## What is Expo?

Expo simplifies the mobile app dev experience by:

- Providing a set of native APIs
- Eliminating the need to eject for most use cases
- Offering a fast development cycle with hot reloading
- Allowing cloud builds and over-the-air updates

## Hello World with Expo

Let’s create your first app step by step.

### 🧱 1. Install Expo CLI

Make sure you have **Node.js** installed, then run:

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```

### 🚀 2. Create a new Expo app

```bash
npx create-expo-app hello-world-app
cd hello-world-app
npm start
```

This will launch the Expo Dev Tools in your browser.

### 📱 3. Run the app

Scan the QR code using the [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) app on your phone, and you’ll see your new app instantly!

## Sample Code

```
<CodeBlock
marginBottom="16"
codes={[
{
code:
`import { Text, View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
return (
<View style={styles.container}>
<Text>Hello, Expo 👋</Text>
</View>
);
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
container: {
flex: 1,
justifyContent: 'center',
alignItems: 'center',
},
});`,
language: "tsx",
label: "App.tsx"
}
]}
/>
```
## Next steps

Here’s what you can do after your first “Hello World”:

- Add navigation using `react-navigation`
- Style your app with Tailwind using `nativewind`
- Fetch data using `axios` or `fetch`
- Use device features with `expo-camera`, `expo-location`, and more

## Why Expo is beginner-friendly

- ✅ No native setup required
- ✅ Fast prototyping and sharing
- ✅ Easy deployment to app stores (with EAS Build)
- ✅ Built-in support for push notifications, updates, and auth
